# GithubPullRequests

Build an Android app which takes in a **:github_owner_name/:github_repo_name** input string from user 
(like ReactiveX/RxJava or square/okhttp) and displays the open pull requests in that Github repo. (only public repos)

Use RxJava for network requests (and other functional programming needs), and other third-party libraries as you see fit.

Use MVVM architecture.
